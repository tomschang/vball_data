plans: repl -> record game | analyze game | save game | load game | customize
  record game ->  record plays keyed one at a time, should be able to pause it
                  and go to analysis mid-game and then return to continue
                  keying game. detect miskeyed plays and ask for corrections
                  at some point. preferably automatically keeps track of
                  score
                  play data type is: player + type of play + quality of play
                  game data type is: list of plays + other meta information

  analyze game -> load analysis formulas (should come with some default
                  analysis formulas), create analysis formulas. Once an
                  analysis formula is defined, should be able to "call" it
                  and have the results appear for each player.
                  would be nice to have the added functionality of loading/
                  creating/calling analysis tables, which display collections
                  of formulas as a table vs players
                  formula data type is: type of play + operations to do based
                  counts of play quality.
                      eg: passing_average =
                          {
                            pass,
                            (3 * 3_pass + 2 * 2_pass + ... + ) / pass
                          }
  customize    -> customize keybindings. keybindings should come in a default
                  json. perhaps could add the option to customize more things,
                  such as adding play_types

ideas:
- use better package for creating repl, such as click.
- include time stamps on recorded plays
- record data using a GUI, so peope can click where attacks started and ended,
  for example
- ...
